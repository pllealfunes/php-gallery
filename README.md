## Description
To create this project I coded along to the Laracast's PHP for Beginner's series. I watched the series as a
way to refresh my PHP skills. I will continue by going on to learning OOP and then Laravel. Lastly, I will
finish a full stack Laravel Vue Inertia Tailwind project. If I needed help to work on features or to figure
out why something was not working I Googled or used ChatGPT.
⭐️ I used XAMPP and PHPMyAdmin for my project setup instead of what was used in the series. ⭐️
